# PyTremor - terminal EEW
PyTremor is a prototype Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) monitoring tool that listens to various real-time EEW data sources using WebSocket connections. It provides detailed earthquake alerts for multiple regions, including Japan, China, and other parts of Asia.
This is an early-stage project and is not yet production-ready. Feedback and contributions are highly encouraged to improve the system.
